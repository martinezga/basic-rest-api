## Basic rest API challenge
____

This project is part of a competition on [HackademyMX](https://github.com/hackademymx).

The main objective is to connect the frontend provided by them with the backend code created by the competitors using [mockapi.io](https://mockapi.io) as a rest API.

### My to-do list:
- Clone HackademyMX repository.
- Create an API using mockapi.io.
- Create "users" endopoint.
- Create a user using the created API.
- Read all users from the API.
- Delete a user by id from the API.
- Verify that the frontend works as expected.
